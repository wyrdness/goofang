      "summary": "An aquatic creature that can only swim and walk backwards, catching fish by swimming in reverse through Minnesota lakes.",
      "full": "The Goofang is one of the most peculiar fearsome critters, cursed or designed to move only in reverse. This fish-like or amphibious creature inhabits Minnesota lakes and can only swim backwards—never forward. According to lumberjack tall tales, the Goofang has adapted to this limitation by becoming an expert backwards swimmer, catching fish by approaching them from behind in reverse. The creature supposedly swims tail-first through the water, using its backward motion to sneak up on prey. The Goofang represents the fearsome critter tradition's love of impossible biological limitations that creatures somehow turn into advantages, creating absurd ecological niches through mock-Darwinian logic."
